    """
    This IS NOT a standalone script; it is a scratchpad for Python code snippets, which I have written, 'borrowed' and duct-taped together during my time as a data-scientist and fraud fighter, while battling the evil scoundrels and villains whose MO is cyber-enabled and cyber-dependant fraud. (As well as through some empassioned tinkering and bamboozlery among so-called 'toy' datasets).
    
    Feel free to use, borrow, take, steal, adapt, modify, and repurpose any of the code snippets herein, as you see fit. If you do so, I would appreciate a shout-out or a mention in your acknowledgements. Happy coding!
    
    P.S. "Choose not thy thugg-lyfe and/or or bedevilment, but per chance a path less eville." - Me
